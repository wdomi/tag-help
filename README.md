Tag-help.html


# What is it?

Tag-help.html is a local "application" to help you find the correct individual filtering by markings' colors and/or numbers.

# The application is based on two individual documents:

- **"markings.csv"**
  - it includes all the data for the tagged animals.
  - you can give it the name of your species (e.g. "ibex.csv", "deer.csv", ...), the name gives the application its title.

- **"tag-help.html"**
  - it is basically a text document that opens in a browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.
  - it is local (on your computer or phone), you do not need to install anything and it does not need internet.

# How does it work?

## 1 – Save and edit the CSV

Save the **"markings.csv"** on your computer and open it in Excel.

**FIRST COLUMN:** enter your preferred language in cell A1.

## 2 – Rest of the table

Change the data to match your animals:

- Individ_ID
- Individ_Name
- Sex
- Age_Cohort = age or cohort
- Mark_R_1_Farbe → colour, right, front
- Mark_R_1_Farbe → colour, right, front
- Mark_R_1_Nr → number (if applicable)
- Mark_R_2_Farbe → colour, right, back
- Mark_R_2_Nr → number (if applicable)
- Mark_L_1_Farbe → colour, left, front
- Mark_L_1_Nr → number (if applicable)
- Mark_L_2_Farbe → colour, left, rear
- Mark_L_2_Nr → number (if applicable)
- collar → 'yes' or number
- remark → any other useful information about the individual markings (e.g. ear markings)

⚠️ **You can delete unneeded columns but you cannot:**

- delete the first language column
- rename headers
- add new columns

## 3 – Use the application

Download the **tag-help.html** on your computer or send **tag-help.html** and your edited **markings.csv** to your phone.

Click on **tag-help.html** to open it in a browser, and import your CSV file (e.g. "markings.csv").

# Warning

If used on your android smartphone the tag-help.html should open automatically in a browser window.

For iPhone users it is necessary to download the app **Documents by Readdle** which allows you to override internal security constraints and open the html in a browser.

For easy access you can "export" or "share" and add to Homescreen.
